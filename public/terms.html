            We do not own any data, information or material (“Content”) that you submit in the Mobile Application in the

            Application does not grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the
            Content created by you or stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar purpose. But
            you grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display and perform the
            Content of your user account solely as required for the purpose of providing the Services to you. Without
            limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right, though not the obligation, to, in
            our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our
            policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable.
            <br />
            <br />
            Adult content
            <br />
            <br />
            Please be aware that there may be certain adult or mature content available in the Mobile Application. A

            content, individuals who are less than 18 years of age or are not permitted to access such content under the
            laws of any applicable jurisdiction may not access such content. If we learn that anyone under the age of 18
            seeks to conduct a transaction through the Services, we will require verified parental consent, in
            accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Certain areas of the Mobile Application may
            not be available to children under 18 under any circumstances.

            <br />
            Although this Mobile Application may link to other mobile applications, we are not, directly or indirectly,
            implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked mobile
            application, unless specifically stated herein. Some of the links in the Mobile Application may be
            “affiliate links”. This means if you click on the link and purchase an item, BHub will receive an affiliate
            commission. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any
            businesses or individuals or the content of their mobile applications. We do not assume any responsibility
            or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third-parties. You should
            carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any mobile application which you access
            through a link from this Mobile Application. Your linking to any other off-site mobile applications is at
            your own risk.

            PAYMENTS (VENUES)
            <br />
            <br />
            Use of the Services implies charges to you for the services or you receive (“Rental Fees”). BHub will
            receive and/or enable your payment of the applicable Charges for services or obtained through your use of
            the Services. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges may include other
            applicable fees.
            <br />

            All Charges and payments will be enabled by BHub using the preferred payment method designated in your
            Account, after which you will receive a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is
            determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that BHub may use a
            secondary payment method in your Account, if available. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable,
            unless otherwise determined by BHub.
            <br />
            <br />
            As between you and BHub, BHub reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all
            services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in BHub’s sole discretion. BHub will
            use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for
            Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
            <br />
            <br />
            After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to
            rate your experience and leave additional feedback. BHub may use the proceeds of any Charges for any
            purpose, subject to any payment obligations it has agreed to with any Third Party Providers or other third
            parties.

            <br />
            Limitation of liability
            <br />
            <br />
            To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will BHub, its affiliates, officers,
            directors, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for (a): any indirect,

            one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you to BHub for the prior one month period prior to the
            first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and exclusions also apply if this
            remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose.
            <br />
            <br />
            Indemnification
            <br />
            <br />

            Severability
            <br />
            <br />
            All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and binding
            only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent
            necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or
            portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court
            of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions
            thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining
            provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and effect.
            <br />
            <br />
            Dispute resolution
            <br />
            <br />
            The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and any disputes arising out of it shall be
            governed by the substantive and procedural laws of Uganda without regard to its rules on conflicts or choice
            of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of Uganda. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions
            related to the subject matter hereof shall be the courts located in Uganda, and you hereby submit to the
            personal jurisdiction of such courts. You hereby waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising
            out of or related to this Agreement. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
            of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
